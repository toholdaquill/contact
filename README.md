How to leak to me (and not get caught)
--------------------------------------

### Text me on Signal: +1 647 269 0074

Signal is free and offers encrypted text messaging, audio calls, and video calls. For the vast majority of cases, Signal is the best, most secure, way to reach me.

Download Signal here: `https://www.signal.org/download`

### What about Wire / Wickr / WhatsApp / Telegram / etc?

Wire offers a similar service to Signal, but permits registration using an email address, and not a phone number. I recommend Signal, but you may contact me on Wire at `@toholdaquill` if Wire is your preference.

WhatsApp offers a similar service to Signal, but Facebook, WhatsApp's parent company, tracks all WhatsApp metadata--including who you contact, how often, for how long, and type of contact, e.g. text, voice call, video call, etc. I do not recommend you contact me via WhatsApp unless you have a very specific reason for doing so. You can reach me at the number above.

Do not use Telegram for anything sensitive.

### When should you *not* use Signal, Wire, or WhatsApp?

If Five Eyes are in your threat model, then no. (If Five Eyes are not in your threat model, or you have no idea what I'm talking about, then just use Signal--you'll be fine.)

If you are worried that the NSA / FBI / CSE / CSIS / RCMP / GCHQ / etc are going to trace your metadata trail to me, then keep reading.

### For national security whistleblowers

1. The first rule of leaking is to never use a work laptop to reach out to a journalist. Take home data on a thumb drive or print it out. Taking pictures of documents on a screen is also a good strategy. Be aware of existing anti-leaking measures your employer may have in place, and look for technical loopholes.

2. Use a personal laptop to contact me. If you're extra cautious, purchase a cheap burner laptop in cash somewhere not too close to home or work. 

3. Don't use your home wifi. Go to a coffeeshop you don't usually visit, or sit in your car outside of a public wifi spot you have access to. Do this a good distance from home, outside your usual pattern of life.

4. Download and install Tor Browser (`https://www.torproject.org`). Tor is a free, secure way to cover your tracks.

5. Email me. You could create a single-use ProtonMail account and email me at `toholdaquill@protonmail.com`, or at `jm@porup.com`. I assume my email is monitored. You should too.

6. OnionShare. Got docs you want to share anonymously? Ping me from a burner email account, or channel of your preference, and I'll give you the address. I'll need to spin up an OnionShare server on my laptop. Navigating to that .onion address in Tor Browser will let you upload files directly to a virtual machine on my computer.

7. ADVANCED USERS ONLY: Use PGP. You'll find my keys on the keyservers.

    PGP fingerprint:

    `7E53 D94D B6B3 E293 9F42  DA9B 759F 1599 B79A 74FB`

    Note: Email sometimes goes missing. If you emailed me but didn't hear back, and it's important, try a different channel.

8. ADVANCED USERS ONLY: Use jabber. Easier to use and arguably more secure than pgp, I like agl's xmpp-client (`https://www.github.com/agl/xmpp-client`). Create an account that supports a Tor onion server. Note: we both have to be online for us to connect on jabber. I live in New York and am usually on jabber for most, but not all, of the work day, Eastern Time.

    My jabber address (not an email address) is `toholdaquill@riseup.net`.

    OTR fingerprint:

    `0d300ae4 24f754cc 2f667658 c5739cfd 722a7fdb`

9. ADVANCED USERS ONLY: Download and install Tails, the anonymity-optimized Debian-based operating system that routes all traffic over Tor. Be sure to download and use Tail only over wifi networks that you've never used before and will never use again, for instance a coffeeshop wifi. 

    You'll find Tails here: `https://tails.boum.org/`
