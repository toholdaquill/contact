# Contact J.M. Porup

Got a story tip? I'm listening...

## How to leak to me (and not get caught)

### Text me on Signal: +1 647 269 0074

Signal is free and offers encrypted text messaging, audio calls, and video calls. For the vast majority of cases, Signal is the best, most secure, way to reach me.

You can download it here: [https://www.whispersystems.org/](https://www.whispersystems.org)

### What about Wire / Wickr / WhatsApp / Telegram / etc?

Telegram should not be used for anything sensitive.

WhatsApp offers a similar service to Signal, but Facebook, WhatsApp's owner, tracks who everyone talks to. I do not recommend you contact me via WhatsApp unless you have a very specific reason for doing so.

If you're fond of Wire you can find me there as @toholdaquill, but I prefer Signal.

### When should you *not* use Signal?

If Five Eyes is in your threat model, then no. (If Five Eyes is not in your threat model, or you have no idea what I'm talking about, then just use Signal--you'll be fine.)

If you are worried that the NSA / FBI / CSE / CSIS / RCMP / GCHQ / etc are going to trace your metadata trail to me, then we move to step 2.

### How to leak to me without getting caught

1. The first rule of leaking is to never use a work laptop to reach out to a journalist. Take home data on a thumb drive or print it out. Taking pictures of documents on a screen is also a good strategy.

3. Use a personal laptop to contact me. If you're extra cautious, purchase a cheap burner laptop in cash somewhere not too close to home or work. 

4. Don't use your home wifi. Go to a coffeeshop you don't usually visit, or sit in your car outside of a public wifi spot you have access to. Do this a good distance from home, outside your usual pattern of life.

5. Download and install [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org). Tor is a free, secure way to cover your tracks.

5. Email me. You could create a throwaway, single-use ProtonMail account and email me at toholdaquill@protonmail.com, or at jm@porup.com. 

6. ADVANCED USERS ONLY: Use PGP. You'll find my keys on the keyservers, fingerprint [here](https://github.com/toholdaquill/contact).

7. ADVANCED USERS ONLY: Use jabber. Easier to use and arguably more secure than pgp, I like agl's [xmpp-client](https://www.github.com/agl/xmpp-client). Create an account that supports a Tor onion server. Note: we both have to be online for us to connect on jabber. I live in New York and am usually on jabber for most, but not all, of the work day. 

My jabber address (not an email address) is toholdaquill@riseup.net. Published [fingerprint](https://github.com/toholdaquill/contact).
